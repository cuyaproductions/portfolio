Having seen great success with the game, the Office of Public Information wanted to bring the experience to the digital world to increase public engagement.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>I helped develop a mobile-friendly web application that used the same increase/decrease/maintain budget feedback mechanism of the board game. This feedback was then collected by the city to report to City Council and the public.</p>\n<h2>Outcome</h2>\n<p>The digital Budget in a Box resulted in a 214% increase in online public engagement, and we received an award of recognition from Mayor Adler on October 1, 2015.</p>\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
