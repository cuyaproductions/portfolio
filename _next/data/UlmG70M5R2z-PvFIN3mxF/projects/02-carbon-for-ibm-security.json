It encompasses numerous web applications, with many more to come. We needed to have a way to ensure consistent user-experiences and design language to establish a brand.</p>\n<h2>My role</h2>\n<p>I collaborated with numerous talented front-end engineers to investigate and test multiple approaches, ultimately creating the library. Later, as an extensive library user, I have implemented several vital components, like the <a href=\"https://ibm-security.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/patterns-filterpanel--default\">Filter Panel</a>, and mentored other engineers in contributing theirs.</p>\n<h2>Outcome</h2>\n<p>The Carbon for IBM Security is now the tool that strings together the experiences for the IBM Cloud Pak for Security platform and applications. The design system has also grown to include a Sketch library for designers.</p>\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
